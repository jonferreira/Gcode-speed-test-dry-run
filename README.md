# Gcode-speed-test-dry-run

Here's a set of "dry run" tests I've created for my BLV Cube. 

Make sure you adjust the dimensions to your printer, this set of tests need a 320 x 320 bed, if yours is smaller adjust the coordinates accordingly.

There's 6 files starting at 100mms and ending at 350mms.

Use at your own risk!
